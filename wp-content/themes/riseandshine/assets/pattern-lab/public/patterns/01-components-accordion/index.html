          <p>Every person is different. Different weights, shapes, ages, with different sensitivities and sleeping preferences. Some people are highly allergic to different materials as well as molds and dust mites. Some want all natural materials and minimal synthetics. Some people are hot sleepers, others are cold sleepers. Some have injuries affecting back, hips, neck, shoulders etc, and some have degenerative illnesses such as osteoporosis.</p>
          <p>The beauty of shopping at rise+shine is that all our stores have a ‘Bed Test Area’ in which the mattresses are there for you to test out and try before you buy!
